## From jQuery To Backbone (+Marionette)

An updated version of my [Image Gallery](https://github.com/derickbailey/hands-on-backbone)
application, to provide a whirlwind tour of
converting a jQuery application to Backbone, and
introducing [MarionetteJS](http://marionettejs.com).

### Legal

The image gallery application is based on the 
code I wrote for the [Hands-on Backbone.js](http://pragprog.com/screencasts/v-dback/hands-on-backbone-js)
screencasts I built for PragProg.com. Copyright
